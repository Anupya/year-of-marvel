## Uses

### 1. Gifts
Enter a significant year and find a comic in that year - you can even find one released near the exact date!

### 2. Research
Google tends to give unclear results about comics when you only care about the year released. Year of Marvel eradicates that problem and makes finding comics simpler by getting reliable content straight from Marvel's mouth (read: API).

## Problem
I often have to find birthday gifts to give to my friends and since a lot of them are comic book nerds, I always try to find something relevant. However, I always find myself getting turned off of the comic book scene because of how hard it is to find everything. For example, there are S0. MANY. COMICS. and it is a pain to find an issue released near my friend's birthday because I am not sure if the issue I found is when the story arc started or when it was released.

## Solution
I decided to nip the problem in the butt and get my information straight from Marvel API. Year of Marvel is an easy-to-use interface that extracts key information about each comic and displays in a pleasing 2-column order.

## Features
- 50 results per page
- enter any year from 1947-now and browse through all (yes, ALL) the comics
- clickable comics that allow you to buy the particular issue directly from the official Marvel website

## Last thoughts
My mind was blown when I first discovered Marvel API and knew I wanted to work with it as soon as possible. It is a super cool API that reveals an unbelievable amount of detail - a treasure chest for comic book nerds.
