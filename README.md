# Year of Marvel
A web application built with Node.js that gives you all the Marvel comics released in a particular year.

## Uses

### Gifts
Enter a significant year and find a comic in that year - you can even find one released near the exact date!

### Research
Google tends to give unclear results about comics when you only care about the year released. Year of Marvel eradicates that problem and makes it simpler.

## Problem
I often have to find birthday gifts to give to my friends and since a lot of them are comic book nerds, I consider it as an option. However, I always find myself getting turned off of the comic book scene because of how hard it is to find everything. For example there are so many Spiderman reboots and it is a pain to find something released in my friend's birth year because I am not sure if that is when the story started or when this particular issue was released.

## Solution
So I decided to nip the problem in the butt and get my information straight from Marvel API and give it to me in a clear fashion. 

## Features
- 50 results per page
- enter any year from 1947-now and get all the comics 

## Last thoughts
My mind was blown when I first discovered Marvel API and knew I wanted to work with it as soon as possible. It is a super cool API that reveals an unbelievable amount of detail for such an established and revered comic book company.
